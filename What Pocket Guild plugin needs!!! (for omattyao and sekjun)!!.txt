for this plugin... I need a feature that gives you more maximum health
everytime a player joins a guild which means if there is 1player in a
guild called miner the player's maximum health in the guild "miner" will
go up 1 so becomes 21 and let's say three people joined... then the max
health will be 23!!! but it MUST only affect the players in the guild!!

this will not be a command... but it will be event and public function!!

so... since I don't think I can do anymore typing...  someone else
should implement this feature.
